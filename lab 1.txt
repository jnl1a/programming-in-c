lab 1
1. (a). feet, fathoms
   (b). declaration: int feet, fathoms
        lvalue is on the left side of "=" which is seen twice....fathoms = 2 (fathoms is lvalue) and feet = 6*fathoms (feet is lvalue)
        rvalue is on the right side of "="...feet = 6*fathoms (the number 6 and fathoms are both rvalues)
